# Introduction
In today’s competitive ride-hailing industry, data-driven decision-making plays a crucial role in improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
This project focuses on analyzing ride booking data of OLA using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization.
The analysis helps in understanding booking success rates, ride cancellations, customer behavior, payment preferences, and performance metrics of drivers and vehicles.

# Objectives of the Project
<br>1.The main objectives of this project are:
<br>2.To analyze successful and cancelled ride bookings
<br>3.To identify top customers based on ride frequency
<br>4.To calculate average ride distance by vehicle type
<br>5.To evaluate driver and customer ratings
<br>6.To analyze payment methods used by customers
<br>7.To compute total revenue from successful rides
<br>8.To identify reasons for incomplete rides

# Tools & Technologies Used
<br>1.MySQL / SQL
Data extraction, filtering, aggregation, and view creation
<br>2.Power BI
Data visualization and dashboard creation
<br>3.MS Excel
Data cleaning and inspection
<br>4.Windows OS
Development environment

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains ride booking information including:
<br>1.Booking ID
<br>2.Customer ID
<br>3.Vehicle Type
<br>4.Ride Distance
<br>5.Booking Status
<br>6.Payment Method
<br>7.Driver Ratings
<br>8.Customer Ratings
<br>9.Booking Value
<br>10.Cancellation & Incomplete Ride Reasons

# Methodology
<br>1.Created a database and imported booking data
<br>2.Used SQL views to answer key business questions such as:
<br>• Successful bookings
<br>• Cancelled rides (customer & driver)
<br>• Average distance per vehicle
<br>• Top customers
<br>• Payment analysis
<br>• Revenue calculation
<br>3.Connected SQL data to Power BI
<br>4.Built interactive dashboards to visualize insights

# Key Insights
<br>1.Prime Sedan shows distinct driver rating trends
<br>2.UPI is a widely used payment method
<br>3.Certain customers frequently book rides (high-value users)
<br>4.Customer-side cancellations are more common than driver-side
<br>5.Incomplete rides have identifiable reasons that can be reduced operationally

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be effectively used for real-world business analytics.
The insights obtained can help OLA improve:
<br>•Customer experience
<br>•Driver performance
<br>•Revenue optimization
<br>•Operational decision-making
